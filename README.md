# Tic-Tac-Toe
Source Code for Tic Tac Toe-game project made by Venkatesh joshi.

 This is a simple mini project in C programming. 
1. The game is to be played between two people (player1 and player2). 
2. We've assigned 'X' to the player-1 and 'O' to the player-2.
3. The game starts with player-1 and the game ends when one of the players completes whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective symbol (â€˜Oâ€™ or â€˜Xâ€™). 
4. If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
